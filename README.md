### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**erikkaincolor/erikkaincolor** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a physical remake of the Hasbro-manufactured [Operation game](https://instructions.hasbro.com/en-us/instruction/Operation-The-Game) "What is the Operation game?") with a digital component. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Intellectual Property, Patents, and Trademarks
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in an open source hackathon
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding community in product management, product development spaces and technical writing.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about museums and contemporary art industry, Lorna Simpson or Alexander Calder, NPR-anything, lasercutting and engraving, 3d printing, and why everyone needs to take my former prof's. *Ethics in Technology* course
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: erikkaincolor+github@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Not big on sweets, yet I use more honey and cinnamon when prepping savory dishes than the average person.
